I've been slowly working my way through the Calibre Libraries on this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/axfk7e/around_a_thousand_calibre_libraries/), removing all the ones that don't work. I've gone through the first 500 links, and these are the ones that worked for me. 102 libraries in all, all English, all containing over 100 books each. https://pastebin.com/ZxXavvpP If this is appreciated, I'll happily post the other links when I've weeded them out. If it's totally.

Hey guys, I'm back with another batch of Calibre libraries, culled from this post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/axfk7e/around_a_thousand_calibre_libraries/). There's 94 this time around. Non-English libraries have been included (by request), and are marked with an asterisk before the link. A couple of the links have special notes on them, as I ran into a few oddities - like a library comprised entirely of fanfiction from AO3 and another one with just sheet music. doc –∏–ª–∏ DOC (–æ—Ç –∞–Ω–≥–ª. document) ‚Äî —Ä–∞—Å—à–∏—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Ñ–∞–π–ª–∞, –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ–º–æ–µ –¥–ª—è —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤, –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—â–∏—Ö —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç, —Å —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ç–∫–æ–π –∏–ª–∏ –±–µ–∑. Sorry if this is a dumb question. I have over 10k books in my library and I save everything in a folder in my documents called Calibre. When I add books a create an update folder within the Calibre folder and then direct Calibre to add those books to the library. Once they've been added, is it safe to delete these folders so I'm not double storing everything on my hard drive. –ù–∞–π—Ç–∏ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ –¥–ª—è Amazon Kindle –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ, –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –∑–Ω–∞–µ—à—å –≥–¥–µ –∏—Ö –∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å. üôÇ –ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é –≤–∞—à–µ–º—É –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏—é —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ —Å–∞–π—Ç–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –≤—ã —Å–º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ—è–∑—ã—á–Ω—ã–µ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ These ones contain mostly english titles: https://95.97.204.213/ (https://95.97.204.213/) (6682 ebooks) ( (4095 ) ( (2903) ( (2003 ) ( (1812 ) ( (1258) http://188.166.4. –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ: –£–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –°–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –õ—É—á—à–∏—Ö –ü—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º –†—É–Ω–µ—Ç–∞, —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—ë–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ –∫–∞—Ç–µ–≥–æ—Ä–∏—è–º, —Å –ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –£—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–æ–π –Ω–∞ –û–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã Windows. amp#x200B; ( (252789 books) ( (146409 books) ( (34937 books) ( (24074 books) ( (16850 books) (http://162. –î–æ–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è —Å–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞–ª —ç—Ç—É –ø–æ–¥–±–æ—Ä–∫—É –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å Vinny M –Ω–∞ —Ñ–æ—Ä—É–º–µ –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–æ–∂–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ –ö–ª—É–±–∞. 
Hello hoarders. Not really open directories and I haven't checked them manually, but these cost me  on shodan.io so I thought I'd share the wealth: https://pastebin.com/PJ1tJxcZ How many books? I have no idea. Have a look round and post some of your favourite troves, or snag the lot. I'm running this script (https://pastebin.com/5jzNMaz9) which was posted by one of our fine hoarders. I made a file that looks like `getcal host:port`, like this one (http://paste.ubuntu.com. Hi, is there a way to change color of the Calibre library window? I figured out how to do it for the reader, but not for the library (the window with book list). I want it darker, because of reading at night. Thanks. in the following calibre library- ( there are several other libraries-i only want to download some of these-the goodreads,npe and nyt libraries,is there a command Is there a way to use different libraries for different categories? I want to have a Calibre library for books and another for audiobooks. I tried just using one library but LL kept adding ebooks to it's audiobook listings. Or is there away to only use Calibre db just for books only and have LL manage the metadata for audiobooks. (french) http://45.56.82.135:8083/. I'm building a small server/nas/whatever with my Rasberry Pi 3 B. I have already some stuff set up (Deluge, Owncloud server, Kodi and Pi Hole), and I was wondering about the most efficient/smooth way to manage a library hosted in the Pi. Right now I have a 6GB (more or less) library. Is stored on the Owncloud server, so each machine that gets connected to the owncloud server downloads the library and can access it locally. Its a slow download process, having some data redundancy Not sure how this happened at all and it's been hugely frustrating. Regardless, I tried to recover as much data as I could but it looks like most of the library ended up being damaged files or just nothing but 'metadata' files with no actual books within their folders. Is there a plugin that can automatically sort through the library and cleanout all the broken/damaged files and empty directories (i.e. with no actual copies of books?) P.S. I love Calibre and I think it's a great I recently reinstalled calibre after refreshing my windows 10 install a whil back and decided to start from scratch as far as my calibre library's concerned. However I keep running into the following error whenever I try to add a book: Traceback (most recent call last): File "site-packages\calibre\gui2\add.py", line 413, in add_book File "site-packages\calibre\db\legacy.py", line 224, in create_book_entry File "site-packages\calibre\db\cache.py", line 63, in call_func_with_lock Great post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/5it5q6/calibre_libraries/ from a year ago.

You need to import it into Calibre and from there you can sync the ebooks or send them via e-mail to your your device. Synchronizing them is the easy way. The numbers behind the title is the word count. I put them there to know how long the story is going to be. 100.000 words are roughly 100 pages. The stories without word count are still in progress so don't. I currently have a small/medium Calibre ebook library and am looking to expand. If you have ebooks, audiobooks, comics, etc, your willing to contribute, we can set up an exchange.  I recently made a disturbing discovery while using Calibre: I clicked on a title and received a "lttitlegt has no available formats" message. I clicked on several other titles and got the same result. I then clicked on the link for the file path and sure enough there is a directory with a cover and a metadata file but no book  Going up one directory level I discovered there was another directory with the same name (but a different number in parentheses following the title) that had a cover. So i got a new laptop and have Win10 64bit. Has anyone encountered this problem. I've been using Google Play Books as my library of ebooks. I upload epubs in there. Would I be able export these books into Calibre without having the original epub files. Some currently open Calibre Libraries:. 
Is there any way to keep two Calibre libraries synced across two Windows 10 PCs? I could set the library to a folder in Dropbox, but would that actually keep the files up to date in the Calibre app?
